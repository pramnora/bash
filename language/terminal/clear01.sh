#!/usr/bin/bash

clear # clear's the terminal screen.../which is similar to CLS inside of Windows CLI/Command Line Interface Prompt

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTE(1): If you continue scrolling up and down...by using your arrow keys...;   
# then, you will see that all of the previous commands you issued/plus, output still remains there...;
# and, it did NOT, quite simply, vanish.


# NOTE(2): Another way to clear the terminal screen is using keyboard shortcut: [CTRL] + [L]
