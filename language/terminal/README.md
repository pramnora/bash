# Linux Terminal

There are 2 ways to use Linux...(whichever flavour of Linux you choose to use)...  

1> GUI/Graphical User Interface mode  
2> CLI/Command Line Interface mode  

...the CLI method gives you more choices.../and, also, does things a lot 'quicker' in many cases. 

-(Most people who are Linux expert's...tend to employ using the Terminal a lot more than they do use the GUI.)-
