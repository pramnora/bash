#!/usr/bin/bash

cat /etc/shells

: '
NOTE(1): The first line of a bash shell script is the above;
         which declares where on the computer system 
          a particular shell can be found...
          ...to use to do bash shell scripting with.

 NOTE(2): Be careful to spell: '/usr/'...; 
          and, not write it as: '/user/'...
	  which would be a wrong misspelling...that produces an error message?!
