## Introduction

For people who are 'beginners' to using Linux...;  
then, using Nano text editor is pretty straight forwards, and, easy.  

>Nano fileName  

The Nano command loads up the file editor.  
If you include a 'fileName' after the nano command...; then, that will be the current file we are editing/saving.  

You can use the arrow keys to move/navigate around: up/down/left/right.  

If you look below...; there should be some menu which will teach you how to further edit text; 
such as how to: 

- [CTRL] + [K] cut   
- Hold down [SHIFT] key...and, press [RIGHT ARROW] to select text  
- [ALT] + [6] to copy  
- [CTRL] + [U] paste  
- etc.
