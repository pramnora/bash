## Introduction

For people who are 'beginners' to using Linux...;  
then, using Nano text editor is pretty straight forwards, and, easy.  

>nano fileName  

The 'nano' command loads up the file editor.  
If you include a 'fileName' after the nano command...; then, that will be the current file we are editing/saving.  

You can use the arrow keys to move/navigate around the text file, including:      
[up]/[down]/[left]/[right]     

If you look below...; there should be some menu text...which will teach you how to further edit text;  
such as how to: 

- Hold down [SHIFT] key...and, press [RIGHT ARROW] to select text  
- [CTRL] + [K] cut   
- [ALT] + [6] to copy  
- [CTRL] + [U] paste  
- [CTRL] + [X] to exit Nano text editor; next, type [Y] to keep changes you've made/or, [N] to lose those changes; finally, pressing [ENTER] key returns you back to the Linux CLI/Command Line Interface.     
- Etc.

**NOTE**: It is very important, indeed, to be able to know how to use your text editor commands/keyboard short cuts really well;  
          especially, if you are going to spend many endless hours and hours/days and days/weeks and weeks/-etc. using it;  
          because, then, you will be able to produce work much more quickly and effectively.   
 
          On the other hand, when you are struggling to learn how to use the editor...;   
          this can prove to be a tremendous barrier in being willing to work using it...;   
          as your production tends to slow down to become an absolute *crawl*...!
