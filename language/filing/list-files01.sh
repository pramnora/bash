# list files inside of the current folder directory...

ls

#NOTE(1): The long form of listing folders/files is to use:    
#         ls -l  
#         ...this will show not just the folder names; but, also, many other details such as:    
#         file permissions dates times size   
#         -etc.  

# NOTE(2): NOT 'all' folders/files will be listed here...; 
#          such as files containing a prefix dot: . are 'hidden' system files;  
#          in order to list all folders/files use:   
#          ls -al  

# NOTE(3): It's also possible to list folders/files inside of a different folder directory, as well; use...;  
#          ls folderName  
#          ...would list all folders/files inside of the 'named' folder directory.
