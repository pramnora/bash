cat << heredoc
This is some heredoc text other people can see/read when interacting
with a bash script program.

NOTE: The word: 'heredoc' both precedes/and, also, 'ends' the file;
      however, you could also have chosen to use any other word such as
      to replace the word: 'heredoc'...with...
      'eof'/meaning, 'end of file'...;
      or else, something perfectly meaningless like: 'xyz';
      /-etc.
      Ultimately, which word to choose to use to begin/end, 
      is left entirely up to the programmer themselves.
